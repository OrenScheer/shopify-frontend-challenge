# Spacestagram
A web application to explore [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) library.

Users can find photos by date, and like and unlike photos. The likes persist between page refreshes, using localStorage.

The fully responsive web app was built with TypeScript, React, and Chakra UI, and deployed using Netlify to [spacestagram.orenscheer.me](https://spacestagram.orenscheer.me).
